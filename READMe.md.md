# XLM-RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Fine Food Reviews

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that fine-tunes the **XLM-RoBERTa** transformer model to perform sentiment classification on the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset. The model was trained using the Hugging Face `transformers` library and evaluated using standard classification metrics.

## üìò Description

The goal of this project is to train a transformer-based model to classify reviews as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** based on their content. The dataset used includes thousands of customer reviews of food products from Amazon.

We used the multilingual but English-capable **XLM-RoBERTa-base** model for its robustness to varied linguistic patterns, which are common in customer reviews.
